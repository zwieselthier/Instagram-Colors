# Instagram Color Graphic Generator 

Instagram Color Graphic Generator will scrape photos from an inputted hashtag and compress the most common colors into a single graphic.

Inspired from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/3rb8zi/the_average_color_of_every_frame_of_a_given_movie/) post on Reddit 


## Usage

1. Enter hashtag you want to scrap without the hashtag symbol
2. Enter the number you want to grab from each image 
3. Include top photos from hashtag or all on page. There tends to be a lot of noise when using all the photos on the page.

Image size can easily be changed in the code.

I recomend trying out diffrend combinations

## Requirements 
Requires the chromedriver to be used with Selenium.

## Examples
Examples are stored in 'Example Graphics' folder

## Note
Since this program scrapes from Instagram it's possible Instagram may change its code and thus break.
